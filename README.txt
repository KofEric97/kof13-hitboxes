THIS VIEWER IS STILL IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT.
Many thing may still be broken, and there may still be mistakes. We're hard
at work to make the viewer more user-friendly, but working correctly is our
highest priority.

This readme document is currently "to be written" in a future commit to this
project.  For now, please refer instead to INSTALL.txt for installation and
startup instructions.

Special thanks to Phoenix for testing, feature suggestions, compiling data
essential for proper discerning of hitbox types, and for fielding user
support.
