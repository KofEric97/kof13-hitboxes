[INTR] Introduction & Compatibility Notes

The current development version of the KOF XIII SE Hitbox Viewer is a Python-
based application that attaches to a running instance of The King of Fighters
XIII Steam Edition.  As such, system requirements for the hitbox viewer are
the same as for the original game, which can be viewed at the game's Steam
store page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/222940/.  There is currently one
exception, however; this version of the hitbox viewer requires support for
Windows Aero, available only on Windows Vista and later editions of Microsoft
Windows.  Aero must also be enabled while running the game in order for the
hitbox viewer to function.  To prevent the game from automatically disabling
Aero on startup, pass the -a command line switch when starting kofxiii.exe.

This hitbox viewer is currently tested and developed with 32-bit builds of
Python 2.7 on Windows.  For reasons of third-party library compatibility,
there are no current plans to extend support to Python 3 or 64-bit Python.
All required components should work the same regardless of whether you're
installing on a 32- or 64-bit version of Windows.  Despite requiring nothing
that isn't available on Windows Vista and above, this tool has so far only
been developed and tested on 64-bit Windows 7 Professional; please report if
you experience compatibility issues with other combinations of hardware or
software.  In terms of video card compatibility, any card supporting DirectX
9.0c and also capable of running the original game should work; the current
development machine uses an AMD Radeon 5670 with 512MB video RAM.  Again,
please report any compatibility problems that you may experience with your
own setup.

[REQS] What You'll Need to Install

The KOF XIII SE Hitbox Viewer requires the following software to be installed:
- Python 2.7 x86: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.7/python-2.7.7.msi
- setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/5.3
- comtypes: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/comtypes/1.1.0
- pydbg: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

If you do not already have the KOF XIII SE Hitbox Viewer downloaded on your
system, you may download it by either of the following means:

Direct download: https://github.com/odabugs/kof13-hitboxes/archive/master.zip
Using Git: git clone https://github.com/odabugs/kof13-hitboxes.git

The Git-based option will allow you to stay up-to-date on the development of
this program at any time with a simple "git pull" on the command line.  If you
are not familiar with Git, you may opt to use the direct download instead, or
you can find more information on Git at: http://git-scm.com/

[ISTL] Installation Step-by-Step

This installation guide assumes that all of the above software packages, as
well as the KOF XIII SE Hitbox Viewer itself, have already been downloaded to
a central folder, which we will refer to as C:\Downloads\.  Replace this with
the actual location where you have saved these packages on your system.
In the same vein, we will refer to your Python installation directory (the
directory where your python.exe resides) as C:\Python27\.
It is advised to install these software packages in the order presented.
Naturally, you will need to have a copy of KOF XIII SE purchased via Steam and
installed on your machine.
NOTE: Administrator privileges may be required at some points in this install.


1. Python
Python 2.7 is provided as an MSI installer package for Windows at the link
given in the REQS section of this document.  You can simply follow the steps
that the installer walks you through, but ensure that you add Python to your
system's PATH environment variable.  During installation, this can be done on
the "Custome Python" screen: simply enable the option that says "Add
python.exe to Path".

If you did NOT add Python to your system's PATH during installation, you can
follow these steps to add it to your PATH after installation:
- Open the Control Panel and open System Properties.
- Click on Advanced System Settings, then the Advanced tab.
- Click on Environment Variables... at the bottom-right corner.
- In the System Variables listing on the bottom half of the screen,
  select PATH (may be rendered as "Path") and click Edit...
- At the end of the line to be edited, type ";C:\Python27\" (without quotes).
- Click OK at all steps to return to the Control Panel.
- Select Run... from the Start Menu and type "python" to test your changes.
  If you were successful, then Python will start up and print a startup line.


2. setuptools
setuptools is used as a means to make the process of installing comtypes in
the next step simpler.  Download ez_setup.py, then double-click on it to "run"
it.  This will automatically "bootstrap" a working setuptools installation.


3. comtypes
Extract comtypes-1.1.0.zip to C:\Downloads\.  Open a command line at
C:\Downloads\comtypes-1.1.0\, and type "python setup.py install".

If you do not know how to navigate in a command line, follow these steps:

- Click "Run" on the Start Menu (or press Windows Key+R).
- Type "cmd", then press Enter.
- Type "cd C:\Downloads\comtypes-1.1.0\", then press Enter.
  (Note: If your actual download folder has a space anywhere in the pathname,
   then put double quote marks around the full path that you type in).
- Type "python setup.py install".  You can close the command line when it
  allows you to type on the prompt again, if installation was successful.


4. pydbg
Download "pydbg-1.2.win32-py2.7.exe" from the link given for pydbg in the
REQS section of this document.  Run the installer and follow its steps.
If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system concurrently,
make sure that you choose the instance of Python that you just installed in
step 1 (in C:\Python27\) when the pydbg installer asks which Python version
it should install itself on top of.

[STRT] Getting Up and Running

After installing all of the above software packages, you may set up and run
the KOF XIII SE Hitbox Viewer.  If you downloaded it via the Git-based
approach, simply navigate to the directory where you performed the "git
clone".  If you downloaded the zip file, extract it to any location, then
open the "kof13-hitboxes-master" folder that it creates upon extraction.

Start the game with Aero enabled before starting the hitbox viewer.  In order
to prevent the game from automatically turning Aero off, pass the -a command
line switch to it on startup.  This can be done on Steam with these steps:

- Open the Steam client and log into your Steam account if necessary.
- Go to Library, then Installed.
- Right-click on King of Fighters XIII in your installed games list.
- Select Properties, then go to the General tab.
- Click Set Launch Options...
- Type "-a" (without quotes) in the Launch Options dialog box.
- Press OK at all steps to return to the Steam client.

Once the game is up and running, start a match in any game mode and double-
click on start.bat in the folder where you installed the hitbox viewer.
It is advised to start the hitbox viewer either during gameplay or shortly
beforehand (e.g., during stage select or character select), since it can
"hang" if left on menu screens for a long enough time.  For this reason,
users may also experience crashes inbetween matches; "your mileage may vary"
regarding stability of the hitbox viewer in its current state, though it
should be stable enough to play a 3v3 match from start to finish.

NOTE: We haven't tried taking this tool online yet, and though it probably won't
result in a ban, we don't advise it (at least for now).  Since this tool works
by setting a software breakpoint on the game's running process, this modifies
the game's memory while it's running, which can be detected by certain anti-
cheat mechanisms.  We currently have no idea how the game's anti-cheat works,
and we don't intend for this to be a tool to aid cheating in online games.
We especially do not intend for this tool to aid users trying to pirate a copy
of KOF XIII; we make no attempt to circumvent the game's built-in copy
protection, and we have no plans to do so.
